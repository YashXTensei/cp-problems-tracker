# 📊 CP Problem Tracker (Full Stack Flask + API)

A structured and scalable Flask-based web application to track competitive programming problems (Codeforces, LeetCode, etc.) with a clean UI and a powerful backend API.

This project evolved from a basic CRUD tracker into a **modular backend system with filtering, pagination, AJAX interactions, and REST-style API design**.
